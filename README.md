# Introduction
<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Khushi Shekhawat</h1>
<h3 align="center">AI/ML Intern | B.Tech CSE | Applied AI Developer</h3>

---

🎓 I'm an AI/ML intern and a Computer Science & Engineering undergraduate with a strong foundation in Python and a passion for building intelligent systems using data. My work is focused on developing scalable and accurate models in computer vision and natural language processing.

With hands-on experience in object detection, classification, and text-based neural networks, I focus on delivering practical AI solutions that bridge academic knowledge with real-world implementation. I enjoy turning abstract concepts into well-documented, production-ready projects using TensorFlow, OpenCV, and modern development tools.

### 💼 Projects & Research Experience

- 🧠 **Object Detection using TensorFlow**  
  Designed and trained a deep learning model for detecting multiple objects using bounding boxes. Utilized TensorFlow and OpenCV with a custom-labeled dataset from Kaggle. Focused on model evaluation using IoU and mAP metrics.

- 🐾 **Pet Face Classification**  
  Built a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify pet faces (dogs vs cats). Implemented image augmentation techniques, handled class imbalance, and improved model generalization using dropout and batch normalization.

- 🏛 **Landmark Detection (Computer Vision)**  
  Created a landmark recognition pipeline using TensorFlow/Keras and a structured image dataset. Trained and fine-tuned models for classification of famous monuments based on image features.

- ✉️ **Text Classification using TensorFlow (NLP)**  
  Developed a sentiment/topic classification model using tokenized text and embedded sequences. Explored LSTM layers and achieved performance tuning with optimizer experiments and learning rate schedules.

### 💡 About Me

I enjoy working on hands-on AI projects that not only challenge my technical skills but also allow me to learn about data, patterns, and systems. I believe in clear communication, clean code, and continuous iteration.

When I'm not coding, you’ll find me exploring AI courses, organizing my workflow on Notion, or curating resources on Pinterest for creative inspiration.
